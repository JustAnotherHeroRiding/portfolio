## Portfolio

Welcome to my world.

This project is meant to be a simple take on the dev website, a place where you can find ways to contact me, or look at all my previous work or what I am currently working on.

## Blogs

With each bigger project or blog that I have finished, I intend to write a blog talking about what I have learned working on it.
